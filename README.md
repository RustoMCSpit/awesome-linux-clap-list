# awesome-linux-clap-list
A list of FOSS clap plugins that work for Linux. FOSS means "Free and Open Source Software", that basically means the source code is freely available to all so there will never be any payment or registration required (fuck iLok)

Please note, some of the below are experiencing GUI bugs and do not work perfectly! The vast majority do work, only AIDA-X. Cardinal, and Octasine are currently broken on Linux but function fine on Windows.

All of the below plugins also work for Windows. For Windows users, I would also advise looking at https://github.com/sdatkinson/NeuralAmpModelerPlugin https://github.com/DamRsn/NeuralNote and https://tonehunt.org (tonehunt is no longer FOSS but it's only a website)

These are also interesting projects https://github.com/moddevices/mod-desktop https://github.com/sonic-visualiser/tony https://github.com/sonic-visualiser/sonic-visualiser

Also, download this: https://github.com/ldrolez/free-midi-chords
If you want realistic sounding instruments, look for .sfz samples and download sfizz. Synths will never get you realistic sounding instruments, you NEED samples.

Oh and by the way, just because it's free doesn't mean you shouldn't donate to support these creators! Your choice!!

Lastly, if any of you nerds want to make a GUI based MIDI chord generator plugin, https://github.com/Miserlou/chords2midi
