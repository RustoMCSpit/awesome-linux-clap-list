# awesome-linux-clap-list ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b0504c63-a4f3-4edd-9dea-09e89b340beb)
A list of FOSS clap plugins that work for Linux _(and Windows too but get Linux for your own sake, detailed below)_. FOSS means "Free and Open Source Software", that basically means the source code is freely available to all so there will never be any payment or registration required (fuck iLok)

You can download these and more using this soon https://github.com/open-audio-stack/open-audio-stack-registry

-----------------------

_how to install linux: 1) copy down your windows product key 2) backup your files to a harddrive 3) install the linux mint cinnamon .iso file from the [linux mint website](https://www.linuxmint.com) 4) use [etcher](https://etcher.balena.io) (download from its website) to put the .iso on a usb flash drive 5) go into bios 6) boot from the usb 7) go through the introduction and then erase all of your computers the storage and install 8) press update all in the update manager 9) celebrate. it takes 15 minutes._

------------------------


Please note, some of the above are experiencing GUI bugs and do not work perfectly! The vast majority do work, only AIDA-X. Cardinal, and Octasine are currently broken on Linux but function fine on Windows.

All of the above plugins also work for Windows. _For Windows users, I would also advise looking at https://github.com/sdatkinson/NeuralAmpModelerPlugin and https://tonehunt.org (tonehunt is no longer FOSS but it's only a website)_

Also, download this: https://github.com/ldrolez/free-midi-chords
If you want realistic sounding instruments, look for .sfz samples and download [sfizz](https://github.com/sfztools/sfizz) (no .clap). Synths will never get you realistic sounding instruments, you NEED samples.

Just because it's free doesn't mean you shouldn't donate to support these creators! Your choice!!

Oh and truly lastly, "but are these plugins as good as paid plugins", mostly yes (besides the sample based ones so far). Plugins have largely just become rehashes of each other, most reverb, compression, EQ, etc. plugins do the exact same thing with a different coat of paint https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tWHFRbooCY https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaDoRa5n8nQ&t=115s

NOTE FOR SELF: Check what licenses the assets of these plugins are under and add here https://github.com/RustoMCSpit/Audio-UI-Components-Library

Art asset questions

I wish to add these assets to a list of free to use UI assets for plugin development.

What license are the assets under? Licenses like GPL, MIT, etc. aren't made for art assets.
Who are they credited to?
What software was used to make them and can you upload the project files for that software which you used to render the assets as well so I can modify it?

maybe i should merge this with OAS https://github.com/open-audio-stack/open-audio-stack-registry/issues/157
